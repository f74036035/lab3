for question B : 

size = 1000
sort(): 0 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 0.01 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.
size = 10000
sort(): 0 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 1.32 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.
size = 100000
sort(): 0.04 seconds

insertion_sort(): 128.09 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.
size = 1000000
sort(): 0.51 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
